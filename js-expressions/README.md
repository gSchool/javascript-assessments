# W0002 - Write and Evaluate JavaScript Expressions

This folder contains questions and challenges related to this standard.

- Answer the questions in [the questions file](questions.md) by replacing "Your answer here..." with your response. You may not be able to answer each one right away, but once you've answered them all correctly you've mastered this standard.

> If the question asks what something evaluates to, be sure to answer with *valid JavaScript syntax*. (eg. `true`, not `True` or `It evaluates to True` or `1`). The quiz is automatically graded, so the computer will not recognize your answers otherwise.

- Make all of the challenges pass by running `npm test` to check your work. You might not be able to finish every challenge right away, but return once you've covered the necessary material to complete all of the challenges.

> If there is a variable that is set to `undefined`, it is intended that you replace `undefined` with your answer. These variables are being tested by automatic tests that are counting on the variables to be named exactly as they are, so do not change the variable names.
